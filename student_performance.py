    Based on the analysis of the student performance dataset, we can observe several key insights:
    1. Attendance and Final Grade Correlation:
        Students with higher attendance rates generally have higher final grades (88-92).
        Lower attendance rates tend to be associated with lower final grades (62 and 68).
        This suggests a positive correlation between attendance and final academic performance.
             
    2. Study Hours and Final Grade:
        Students who study more hours per week have higher final grades (90 and 92).
        Conversely, students with lower study hours have lower final grades (62 and 68).
        This indicates that increased study time likely contributes to better academic performance.
             
    3. Previous Grades as Indicators:
        Students with high previous grades continue to perform well in their final grades .
        However, students who had lower previous grades show similarly lower final grades (62 and 68), indicating that past performance can be an indicator of current academic success.
        
    4. Impact of Extracurricular Activities:
        Students involved in more extracurricular activities with 3 also show strong academic performance.
        However, students with no extracurricular activities suggesting that engagement outside of academics may contribute positively to student outcomes.
             
    5. Parental Support:
        High parental support correlates with higher final grades, as seen in students having "High" support. 
        Lower levels of parental support, such as "Low" are associated with lower final grades (62, 68, 72).
