This dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains information about student performance, including various factors such as attendance rate, study hours per week, previous grades, extracurricular activities, and parental support.
The purpose of this exploration is to gain insights into the key factors influencing students' final grades and identify any potential correlations between these variables.

        Based on the analysis of the student performance dataset, we can observe several key insights:
        1. Variables such as **AttendanceRate**, **StudyHoursPerWeek**, and **PreviousGrade** seem to have a strong correlation with **FinalGrade**.
        2. The correlation heatmap shows that students with higher parental support tend to perform better.
        3. Outliers can be identified using box plots, providing insights into extreme cases of student performance.

        These insights can help educators focus on key areas to improve student outcomes.
